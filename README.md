# CSCD300Lab3
Recursive Project

Purpose

The purpose of this assignment is to allow you to demonstrate knowledge of recursive programming. This assignment should be done by you without outside help (other than from your instructor).

Specifics

•	As defined in the MyLinkedList class, you have to use a dummy head node for the Linked List class.
•	Please implement two methods in the MyLinkedList class, 1) private MyLinkedList reverse(ListNode node); 2) private ListNode reverse(ListNode prev, ListNode subHead). The requirements and specifications for each method are provided in the comments above each method header. You are permitted to add helper methods into the class as needed.
•	You are NOT allowed to change or revise the provided AddFirst()  and toString() methods in the MyLinkedList class.
•	You are NOT allowed to change the interface and signature (the list of arguments and their type, and return type) of the provided public methods in the MyLinkedList class.
•	Please implement another six methods in the Tester class as instructed by the comments on top of those method headers. You are permitted to add helper methods into the Tester class if needed.
•	You are NOT allowed to change the interface and signature (the list of arguments and their type, and return type) of the provided methods in the Tester class.
•	You are NOT allowed to change any code in the provided main() method and the init() method in the Tester class. However, during your testing and debugging, you can comment out some method calls in the main() of the Tester class in order to single out the method that you are currently debugging. After finish debugging, please make sure all methods are called (uncommented) in the main() of the Tester class, as it was initially provided by the instructor. 
•	Please read and understand the design and implementation of the Tester class. So that you can imitate its design in other projects when perform testing.


List of methods you have to implement
In the MyLinkedList class
1.	private MyLinkedList reverse(ListNode node)
2.	private ListNode reverse(ListNode prev, ListNode subHead)

In the Tester Class
3.	public int countSpace(String str)
4.	public boolean myContains(String s1, String s2)
5.	public int div(int m, int n) throws IllegalArgumentException
6.	private boolean isSum24(int arr[], int targetSum) 
7.	private void reverseArray(int a[], int low, int high)
8.	private void recursiveSelectionSort(int a[], int low, int high)
